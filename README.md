# finite_automata_pattern_matcher
This project simulates a finite automaton to check if a binary string ends with "101." It processes each character, transitioning through states to match the pattern. The string is accepted if the automaton reaches the final state after reading all characters. This showcases the finite state machine concept in C++ for pattern recognition.
